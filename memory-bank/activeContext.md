# 🎯 UDance Active Context

## Current Focus
**PHASE**: Multi-App Separation Implementation 🚀 **IMPLEMENT MODE ACTIVE**
**STATUS**: Creative Phase Complete → Phase 1.1 Starting
**PRIORITY**: CRITICAL - Shared Package Foundation (Database Integration)

## Recent Achievements ✅ (CREATIVE PHASE COMPLETE!)
- **🎨 All 6 Creative Decisions Finalized**: Solo dev optimized approach
- **📐 Architecture Decisions**: Subdomain strategy, app-specific UI packages, Supabase auth
- **🎯 Implementation Strategy**: 6-phase migration plan with realistic timelines
- **🔧 Technology Validation**: All tech decisions validated for single developer workflow
- **📋 IMPLEMENT MODE Ready**: Detailed implementation steps documented

## ✅ Creative Decisions Made (Solo Dev Optimized)

### 1. **Cross-App Navigation**: Subdomain Strategy + Shared Session
- Structure: `app.udance.com`, `admin.udance.com`, `pwa.udance.com`
- Auth: Supabase cookies shared across `.udance.com`
- Implementation: Direct subdomain switching, shared nav component

### 2. **Shared Component Strategy**: App-Specific Packages 
- `packages/ui-web`, `packages/ui-admin`, `packages/ui-pwa`
- Approach: Start with duplication, consolidate later
- Rationale: Faster implementation, zero conflicts for solo dev

### 3. **Authentication UX**: Shared Auth State + Sync
- Supabase built-in cross-domain capabilities
- EventListener for cross-tab sync
- Role-based routing per app

### 4. **Mobile PWA Patterns**: Web-Standard Touch
- Touch-friendly sizes (44px minimum)
- CSS transform feedback
- Simple offline indicators

### 5. **Admin DaisyUI Design**: Custom DaisyUI Theme
- DaisyUI theme with UDance purple/pink branding
- Out-of-box components, minimal custom CSS

### 6. **Performance Strategy**: Standard Next.js
- Leverage Next.js defaults
- Bundle analyzer for monitoring
- Don't over-optimize prematurely

## 🚀 Active Implementation Phase

**CURRENT PHASE**: Phase 1.1 - Enhance `packages/shared/`
**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: Database Integration Migration

### Next Steps (Starting Now):
1. **Move Database Types**: Migrate `database.types.ts` from apps/web/src/lib/
2. **Move Schema**: Migrate `database-schema.sql` to shared package
3. **Shared Supabase**: Create shared client factories
4. **Auth Utilities**: Move Supabase middleware to shared

### Implementation Timeline:
- **Week 1**: Phase 1-2 (Shared packages + Admin app)
- **Week 2**: Phase 3-4 (PWA app + Web cleanup)  
- **Week 3**: Phase 5-6 (CI/CD + Integration testing)

## Current Technical State
- **Next.js 15**: Multi-app ready monorepo structure
- **Database**: Supabase operational with sample data
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth working across current structure
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.x operational, ready for DaisyUI integration
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions ready for multi-app deployment

## Key Decisions Context
- **Solo Developer**: All choices optimized for single dev maintenance
- **Simplicity First**: Choose simple implementation over perfect architecture
- **Migration Strategy**: Start simple, iterate and improve
- **Risk Management**: Validate each phase before proceeding

## Blockers/Dependencies
- None - Ready to proceed with implementation
- All creative decisions finalized and documented
- Technology validation complete

## Success Metrics for Current Phase
- [ ] Database types successfully moved to shared package
- [ ] Shared Supabase client working across apps
- [ ] Auth utilities properly shared
- [ ] Build system updated for new structure
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved during migration

## 🎯 CURRENT TASK: Multi-App Separation Migration

### Task Overview
- **Type**: Level 4 - Complex System Architecture Migration
- **Scope**: Separate monolithic Next.js into 3 independent applications
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks estimated
- **Current Structure**: Single Next.js app with mixed routes
- **Target Structure**: Independent Web, Admin (DaisyUI), PWA applications

### 📊 Current Technical Analysis
- **Admin Content**: 9KB, 226 lines (manageable migration)
- **PWA Content**: 5KB, 128 lines (simple migration)  
- **Infrastructure**: Turbo + scripts already reference non-existent admin/pwa apps
- **Dependencies**: All required packages available in current web app
- **Build System**: Ready for multi-app expansion

### 🎨 NEXT PHASE: Creative Mode (2-3 days)

**Six Critical Design Decisions Required:**

#### 1. **Cross-App Navigation Architecture** (2-3 hours)
- How users move between applications
- Options: URL redirects, embedded iframe, native app links
- Impact: User experience, session management, performance

#### 2. **Shared Component Strategy** (3-4 hours)  
- Which components to share vs duplicate
- Options: Monolithic shared library, app-specific, hybrid
- Impact: Bundle size, development velocity, consistency

#### 3. **Authentication UX Flow** (2-3 hours)
- SSO experience across applications
- Options: Central auth app, distributed auth, token-based
- Impact: Security, user experience, complexity

#### 4. **Mobile PWA Interaction Patterns** (4-5 hours)
- Touch gestures, offline UX, navigation patterns
- Options: Native-like, web-first, hybrid approach
- Impact: Mobile user experience, development complexity

#### 5. **Admin Interface DaisyUI Design** (3-4 hours)
- Component selection, theming, customization approach
- Options: Default DaisyUI, custom theme, hybrid components
- Impact: Admin efficiency, development speed, maintenance

#### 6. **Performance & Bundle Strategy** (2-3 hours)
- Code splitting, lazy loading, shared dependencies
- Options: App-specific bundles, shared chunks, dynamic imports
- Impact: Performance, build complexity, caching strategy

**Total Creative Phase**: 16-22 hours across 2-3 days

### 🚨 Technology Validation Gate
